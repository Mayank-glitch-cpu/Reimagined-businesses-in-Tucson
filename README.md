## Project Overview

This project showcases a complete data analysis workflow, covering:
- Data scraping and JSON parsing from the Yelp dataset,
- Preprocessing and structuring data using Spark SQL,
- Executing advanced SQL queries to extract insights,
- Visualizing key findings with `matplotlib`, and
- Generating business-relevant insights to guide strategic decisions.

Through this analysis, we transform raw Yelp data into meaningful patterns and trends that provide valuable insights into various business dimensions.

## Data Description

### Yelp Dataset
The data utilized in this notebook is sourced from Yelp and is structured as JSON files. The dataset includes information about businesses, user reviews, ratings, and other relevant details that provide a snapshot of the customer experience.

- **JSON Structure**: The dataset comes in JSON format, with fields such as `business_id`, `name`, `rating`, `review_count`, `categories`, and `location`.
- **Entities Analyzed**: Businesses (including type and location), reviews, and ratings, each contributing to a comprehensive view of business performance.

### Key Features
The dataset offers a rich set of features, allowing us to analyze:
- Customer sentiment and satisfaction through ratings,
- Business popularity via review counts,
- Common business categories, and
- Geographic patterns in business success.

Each feature contributes to understanding and predicting business patterns, which supports stakeholders in making data-driven decisions.

## Business Analysis Objectives

The primary objectives of this analysis are to:
1. **Extract Customer Sentiment**: Analyze reviews and ratings to identify trends in customer satisfaction.
2. **Popular Business Categories**: Identify popular categories to inform potential investments and new business opportunities.
3. **Geographic Insights**: Determine trends by location to identify thriving business areas.
4. **Evaluate Business Metrics with SQL Queries**: Use Spark SQL to efficiently query large datasets for targeted insights.

These objectives highlight insights that enable proactive, data-driven decision-making to enhance business performance.

## Getting Started

## Usage

Open the `milestone1.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells step-by-step. The notebook is organized as follows:

1. **Data Loading and JSON Parsing**: Load and parse Yelp JSON data into a structured format suitable for analysis.
2. **Data Preprocessing with Spark SQL**: Utilize Spark SQL to preprocess and query large datasets effectively.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Execute SQL queries to explore business metrics and uncover hidden patterns.
4. **Visualization of Insights**: Use `matplotlib` to plot the analysis results and visually interpret trends.
5. **Business-Level Insights**: Provide actionable insights based on the results of Spark SQL queries and visualizations, highlighting key findings relevant to business strategy.

### Sample Code Execution

```python
# Example of loading JSON data
import json
import pandas as pd

with open('yelp_data.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

# Converting to DataFrame for Spark SQL
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Example Spark SQL query for top-rated businesses
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("YelpAnalysis").getOrCreate()
spark_df = spark.createDataFrame(df)
spark_df.createOrReplaceTempView("businesses")

top_rated = spark.sql("SELECT name, rating FROM businesses WHERE rating > 4.5")
top_rated.show()
```

## Results and Insights

The notebook generates a comprehensive suite of visualizations, statistical summaries, and business-level insights. Some of the key results include:

- **High-Rating Businesses**: Identification of businesses with top customer ratings, providing insight into best practices and areas of customer satisfaction.
- **Popular Categories**: Most frequently occurring business categories, helping to inform market trends and potential investment opportunities.
- **Geographic Distribution**: Analysis of business performance by location, highlighting regions with higher customer satisfaction and successful business models.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Insights into relationships between review counts, ratings, and business popularity, aiding in understanding what drives business success.

These insights offer a foundation for strategic business decisions, such as identifying high-potential areas for expansion, understanding customer preferences, and recognizing key factors that impact customer satisfaction.
